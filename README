                      Sprint One Release: Agile Artichoke

                                      ***

OVERVIEW
    Digital Deck is a cross-platform, multiplayer card game. It uses
    a client-server model, with one user initiating a game and setting the
    rules. The app then uses ZeroConf (Bonjour) to advertise the game on the
    LAN, where others may connect to it. Once the requisite number of players
    have connected to the host, the game begins automatically. The host device
    handles all of the game logic, and updates the clients with new state as the
    game progresses.

    The app supports multiple game types; at the moment development is focused
    on Euchre and Hearts.

BUILDING
    To build and test the application, simply open Yookr.xcodeproj and select
    Build & Run. (Yookr was the name of the iOS version before we settled on
    a shared name, it doesn't appear anywhere in the running application.) The
    app should then start in the iOS simulator.

OPERATION
    Functionality in this first release is quite limited. The game selection
    menus have been implemented, and it is able to display advertised network
    games. It is not yet capable of broadcasting a game of its own.

    To begin, tap the PLAY button at the main screen. This will slide up
    a screen with a list of all available network games, sorted by type. Euchre
    is the only type that is added to the list at the moment, its table header
    will be visible even if there are no games available. This will change in
    the next version. There is also an item at the top that allows you to create
    a new game. Tapping any of the items in the list will take you to the
    appropriate mock screen, either a list of current players (for a network
    game), or a list of options (for a new game). Tapping either "Join Game" or
    "Create Game" from these screens will take you to an empty view that will
    become the "lobby" where you wait for the game to start.

    Since game creation is not yet implemented, we have provided a small extra
    application (Imposter.app) that advertises a simulated network game, which
    will allow you to access the "Join Game" view. Simply run it and press the
    button. The simulated game should appear in the list within a few moments.
